### Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is KhoiHuynh1109. Because when using **Zalo**, I met a friend who used his account as a bot that is actually similar to a **Telegram** bot with the `pyTelegramBotAPI` module. So, I was very interested and consulted his method and decided to create a module that looks exactly like a `telebot` called `zalobot` but has certain limited functions due to processing requirements as well as limitations about **Zalo's** mechanism.
